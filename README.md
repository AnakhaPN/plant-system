Students can understand by the simulation demonstrating how different systems are interconnected. Low water concentration will reduce transport and close stomata which will affect the rate of photosynthesis. This will consequently affect the nutrient supply for the rest of the plant and their function such as flower, fruits, seeds, etc.
